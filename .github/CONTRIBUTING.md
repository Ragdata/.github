# Contributing to this project

Firstly, I'd like to thank you personally for taking the time to help improve this project, I truly appreciate it! 💓 Here are a few guidelines to help ensure that all contributions are heading in the same direction:

You can contribute by:

- creating pull requests
- giving the project a star ⭐
- creating or responding to issues
- supporting the development and maintenance of my projects by [sponsoring me on GitHub][sponsorship] by taking up a monthly subscription or by making one-off donations.
- supporting me through one of my social channels (see [SUPPORT][support])

## Basic Process

Generally, the way to create a **Pull Request** is to:

1. Fork this project and clone it locally
2. Create a new branch from the master branch and give it a descriptive name followed by the issue number, if applicable (format: `feature/<new feature> [#issue]` or `fix:<bug> [#issue]`)
3. AFTER completing development AND TESTING, submit a new _Pull Request_
   1. (note that your commit message MUST follow the [Conventional Commits Guidelines][conventional-commits], otherwise it will fail the PR check)

## Javascript Style Guide

If your contribution includes javascript, please read the following:

### Inline Scripts

If you need to add comments to the inline Javascript code (code between the `<script>   </script>` tags), please be sure to use `/*  */` instead of double slashes.
