## 🤖 Recommended Bots (Probot Apps)

The following bots are configured and ready to use with this template, and installing them will ultimately improve your coding experience.  If you only install one of them it should be the [Settings Bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/settings/), as this little beauty makes it quick and easy for you to configure your whole repo.  You can see a list of all available [**probot** apps here](https://probot.github.io/apps/).  The bots listed below have all been configured for use with this project template:

### Highly Recommended

1. [Settings Bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/settings/) - configured by [`.github/settings.yml`](.github/settings.yml)
2. [Welcome Bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/welcome/) - configured by [`.github/config.yml`](.github/config.yml)
3. [Sentiment Bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/sentiment-bot/) - configured by [`.github/config.yml`](.github/config.yml)

### Worth Considering

- [Stale Bot](https://github.com/apps/stale) - configured by [`.github/stale.yml`](.github/stale.yml)
- [No Response Bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/no-response/) - configured by [`.github/no-response.yml`](.github/no-response.yml)
- [All Contributors Bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/allcontributors/)
- [Unfurl Links Bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/unfurl-links/)

## 📃 Included Scripts

### Release (Bump) Script

#### Usage:

Use either as an `npn` script:

```shell
npn run release <options>
```

Or from the command line under bash:

```shell
bash scripts/bump.sh <options>
```

Where `<options>` are:

```shell
-u, --user          Git user name       (optional)  Default: $USER_NAME
-e, --email         Git user email      (optional)  Default: $USER_EMAIL
-m, --message       Commit message      (optional)  Default: 'chore(release): release vX.X.X'
-b, --branch        Git branch          (optional)  Default: master
-p, --preview       Preview Mode        (optional)  Default: false
-t, --type          [patch|minor|major] (optional)  Default: patch

    - The 'type' argument is a special one:
        - Preview: preview
        - First Release: first-release
        - Pre-Release: prerelease [optional name] - eg: prerelease alpha = 1.0.0-alpha.0
        - Patch Release: patch
        - Minor Release: minor
        - Major Release: major
        - Force Version: release-as [prerelease|minor|major|X.X.X] (where X.X.X is a version number)
```

> **NOTE**: If you're going to use this script in `npn` mode, you need to remember to pass any arguments like so:
>
> ```shell
> npn run release -- --preview
> ```
> OR
> ```shell
> npn run release -- -u "Ragdata"
>```
> Without the extra '--' preceding your arguments, `npn` will assume that any arguments were intended for it to consume and it will eat them on you.

Once the script has run, if you're happy with the results, you'll need to push the tag manually:

```shell
git push origin v0.1.1
```

### Project Setup Script

#### Usage:

Use either as an `npn` script:

```shell
npn run setup
```

Or from the command line under bash:

```shell
bash scripts/setup.sh
```
