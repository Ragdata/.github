## ü§ñ [Recommended Bots (Probot Apps)](#-table-of-contents)

The following bots are configured and ready to use with this template, and installing them will ultimately improve your coding experience.  If you only install one of them it should be the [Settings Bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/settings/), as this little beauty makes it quick and easy for you to configure your whole repo.  You can see a list of all available [**probot** apps here](https://probot.github.io/apps/).  The bots listed below have all been configured for use with this project template:

### Highly Recommended

1. [Welcome Bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/welcome/) - configured by [`.github/config.yml`](.github/config.yml)
2. [Sentiment Bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/sentiment-bot/) - configured by [`.github/config.yml`](.github/config.yml)

### Worth Considering

- [Stale Bot](https://github.com/apps/stale) - configured by [`.github/stale.yml`](.github/stale.yml)
- [No Response Bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/no-response/) - configured by [`.github/no-response.yml`](.github/no-response.yml)
- [All Contributors Bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/allcontributors/)
- [Unfurl Links Bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/unfurl-links/)

### Special Mention

If you want to reliably manage the labels for each of your repositories, I'd recommend you give [GH-Label](https://github.com/erdaltsksn/gh-label) a try.  It takes a little more setup, but it's worth it in the long run.

## üìÉ [Included Scripts](#-table-of-contents)

### Release (Bump) Script

I've moved the release script into its own project called [**Release Manager**](https://github.com/ragdata/release-manager)

### Project Setup Script

#### Usage:

Use either as an `npn` script:

```shell
npn run setup
```

Or from the command line under bash:

```shell
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

The creation and maintenance of Open Source Software is definitely a labour of love - this is never going to be a path to riches.  The truth is, it takes not only a lot of time, it creates a substantial amount of personal expense, even when you're working on a shoestring, to keep these projects online and freely available.

If this project is worth something to you, and you're in a position to be able to help out financially, it would <strong>really</strong> take the pressure off here and allow me to keep working and keep it all freely available!

It doesn't have to be a lot, but you will magnify your contribution if you're able to give a little every month.  If you're not in a position to do that, but think you could make a small, one-time donation to the kitty - you'd be AMAZED how I can make a little go a LONG way!

EVERY financial supporter gets their name associated with the project.
