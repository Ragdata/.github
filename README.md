## ‚≠ê [Project Overview](#toc)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a specially-named repository which GitHub treats differently to other repositories.  [Find out more]()

> ‚ú® This repository is configured as a [Public Template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) - which means you can use it as the basis for your own repositories (and automatically include ALL files in this repository) just by clicking [HERE](https://github.com/Ragdata/.github/generate) 

This repository was created with 2 purposes in mind:

1. To serve as my default & community health files repository
2. To serve as a template for YOU to use when creating your own repositories

Why would you do that?  Because I've been quite pedantic about assembling EVERY file you need to create a well-supported, healthy community for your project so that YOU DON'T HAVE TO!

Seriously, this project has every file a GitHub project could possibly need, all ready and waiting for you to edit them and make them your own!

(See [What's Included](#-whats-included) for a list of files)

### ü§ñ [Recommended Bots & GitHub Apps](#toc)

In a directory of their own (so they don't cause you any unexpected issues) you can find a collection of config files for recommended GitHub Apps that I thought you might find useful. 

#### Highly Recommended

1. Welcome Bot - configured by [`.github/.bots/config.yml`](.github/.bots/config.yml) [Learn More](https://probot.github.io/apps/welcome/)
2. Sentiment Bot - configured by [`.github/.bots/config.yml`](.github/.bots/config.yml) [Learn More](https://probot.github.io/apps/sentiment-bot/)
3. All Contributors - configured by [`.all-contributorsrc`](.all-contributorsrc)  [Learn More](https://allcontributors.org/)

#### Worth Considering

1. Stale Bot - configured by [`.github/.bots/stale.yml`](.github/.bots/stale.yml)  [Learn More](https://github.com/apps/stale)
2. No Response Bot - configured by [`.github/.bots/no-response.yml`](.github/.bots/no-response.yml)  [Learn More](https://probot.github.io/apps/no-response/)

### [üìÄ GitHub Apps Worth Considering](#toc)

#### [GitHub Label Manager][gh-label]

If you want to reliably manage labels for each of your repositories, I'd recommend you take a look at [GH-Label][gh-label].  It takes a little more setup than others, but it's worth it in the long run.  Honestly, I tried the _Settings Bot_ and a couple of other workflow-based solutions, but the just didn't perform consistently at all whenever I had more than 10 labels configured.  Don't waste your time trying to use anything else.

## üìÇ [Installation](#toc)

Installation literally couldn't be any easier - you've got 2 choices:

1. Use this repo as a [template for your own](https://github.com/Ragdata/.github/generate)
2. [Fork this repo](https://github.com/Ragdata/.github/fork) and edit as you see fit

Then you just need to install and configure any GitHub Apps you want to include, and customize any of the other files as you require.

## üëç [Supporting the Project](#toc)

The creation and maintenance of Open Source Software is definitely a labour of love - this is never going to be a path to riches.  The truth is, it takes not only a lot of time, it creates a substantial amount of personal expense (even when you're working on a shoestring) to keep these projects freely available for all.

If this project is worth something to you, and you're in a position to be able to help out financially, it would <strong>really</strong> take the pressure off here and allow me to keep working and keep it all freely available!

It doesn't have to be a lot, but you will magnify your contribution if you're able to give a little every month.  If you're not in a position to do that, but think you could make a small, one-time donation to the kitty - you'd be AMAZED how I can make a little go a LONG way!

EVERY financial supporter gets their name associated with the project.
