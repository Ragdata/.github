### ü§ñ [Recommended Bots (Probot Apps)](#-table-of-contents)

The following bots are configured and ready to use with this template, and installing them will ultimately improve your coding experience.  If you only install one of them it should be the [Settings Bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/settings/), as this little beauty makes it quick and easy for you to configure your whole repo.  You can see a list of all available [**probot** apps here](https://probot.github.io/apps/).  The bots listed below have all been configured for use with this project template:

#### Highly Recommended

1. [Welcome Bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/welcome/) - configured by [`.github/config.yml`](.github/config.yml)
2. [Sentiment Bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/sentiment-bot/) - configured by [`.github/config.yml`](.github/config.yml)

#### Worth Considering

- [Stale Bot](https://github.com/apps/stale) - configured by [`.github/stale.yml`](.github/stale.yml)
- [No Response Bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/no-response/) - configured by [`.github/no-response.yml`](.github/no-response.yml)
- [Unfurl Links Bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/unfurl-links/)

### üìÄ [Recommended GitHub Apps](#-table-of-contents)

The following GitHub Apps are NOT pre-configured for use with this repository, but those that I've listed here are the ones I end up using over and over again in my repositories.  It would be well worth your time to check these out:

#### [ALL-Contributors][all-contributors]

If you're building a community around your repository and you'd like to recognise everyone's input, then you can't go past [**All-Contributors**][all-contributors].  With this app, all you need to do is add a comment to any GitHub Issue or Pull Request attached to your repository, and the app will take care of making sure that person's contribution is recorded.

#### [GitHub Label Manager][gh-label]

If you want to reliably manage the labels for each of your repositories, I'd recommend you give [**GH-Label**][gh-label] a try.  It takes a little more setup, but it's worth it in the long run.  Honestly, I tried the _Settings Bot_ and other workflow-based solutions, but they just didn't perform consistently at all whenever I had any more than 10 labels configured.  Don't waste your time trying to use anything else.

The creation and maintenance of Open Source Software is definitely a labour of love - this is never going to be a path to riches.  The truth is, it takes not only a lot of time, it creates a substantial amount of personal expense, even when you're working on a shoestring, to keep these projects online and freely available.

If this project is worth something to you, and you're in a position to be able to help out financially, it would <strong>really</strong> take the pressure off here and allow me to keep working and keep it all freely available!

It doesn't have to be a lot, but you will magnify your contribution if you're able to give a little every month.  If you're not in a position to do that, but think you could make a small, one-time donation to the kitty - you'd be AMAZED how I can make a little go a LONG way!

EVERY financial supporter gets their name associated with the project.
